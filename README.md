**Para** was designed as a simple and modular backend framework for object persistence and retrieval.
It helps you build applications faster by taking care of the backend. It works on three levels -
objects are stored in a NoSQL data store or any old relational database, then automatically indexed
by a search engine and finally, cached.

The name "p√°ra" means "steam" in Bulgarian. And just like steam is used to power stuff, you can use
Para to power your mobile or web application backend.

**Para** can be used as a direct dependency to your JVM-based application or as a standalone API server with
multiple applications and clients connecting to it.

See how **Para** [compares to other open source backend frameworks](https://erudika.com/blog/2015/10/21/backend-frameworks-usergrid-loopback-para-baasbox-deployd-telepat/).

### Features

- RESTful JSON API secured with Amazon's Signature 4 algorithm
- Database-agnostic, designed for scalable data stores (DynamoDB, Cassandra, MongoDB, etc.)
- Full-text search (Elasticsearch by default)
- Distributed object cache (Hazelcast by default)
- Multi-tenancy support - each app has its own table, index and cache
- IoT support and integration with AWS and Azure
- Flexible security based on Spring Security (Social login, JWT support, CSRF protection, etc.)
- Simple but effective resource permissions for client access control
- Robust constraint validation mechanism based on JSR-303 and Hibernate Validator
- Per-object control of persistence, index and cache operations
- Modular design powered by Google Guice and support for plugins
- I18n utilities for translating language packs and working with currencies
- Standalone executable WAR with embedded Jetty
- [Para Web Console](https://console.paraio.org) - admin user interface

## Documentation

### [Read the Docs](https://paraio.org/docs)

## Quick Start

1. [Download the latest executable WAR](https://github.com/Erudika/para/releases)
2. Execute it with `java -jar para-X.Y.Z.war`
3. Call `curl localhost:8080/v1/_setup` to get the access and secret keys
4. Open [Para Web Console](https://console.paraio.org) or integrate with one of the API clients below.

### Building Para

Para can be compiled with JDK 6 and up, but we recommend running it on JDK 8+.

To compile it you'll need Maven. Once you have it, just clone and build:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/erudika/para.git && cd para
$ mvn install -DskipTests=true
```

### Standalone server

You can run Para as a standalone server by downloading the executable WAR and then:

```sh
$ java -jar para-X.Y.Z.war
```

The you can browse your objects through the **Para Web Console** [console.paraio.org](https://console.paraio.org).
Simply change the API endpoint to be your local server and connect your access keys.
The admin interface is client-side only and your secret key is never sent over the the network. Instead,
a JWT access token is generated locally and sent to the server on each request.

Alternatively, you can grab the WAR file and deploy it to your favorite servlet container.

### [Download WAR](https://github.com/Erudika/para/releases)

### Maven dependency

You can also integrate Para with your project by adding it as a dependency. Para is hosted on Maven Central.
Here's the Maven snippet to include in your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.erudika</groupId>
  <artifactId>para-server</artifactId>
  <version>1.23.1</version>
</dependency>
```

## Command-line tool

- **Para CLI**: [para-cli](https://github.com/erudika/para-cli)

```sh
$ npm install -g para-cli
```

## API clients

Use these client libraries to quickly integrate Para into your project:

- **Java**: [para-client](https://github.com/erudika/para/tree/master/para-client)
- **JavaScript / Node.js**: [para-client-js](https://github.com/erudika/para-client-js)
- **PHP**: [para-client-php](https://github.com/erudika/para-client-php)
- **C# / .NET**: [para-client-csharp](https://github.com/erudika/para-client-csharp)
- **Android**: [para-client-android](https://github.com/erudika/para-client-android)
- **Swift / iOS**: [para-client-ios](https://github.com/erudika/para-client-ios)

## Database integrations

Use these `DAO` implementations to connect to different databases:

- **DynamoDB**: `AWSDynamoDAO` (part of the `para-server` package)
- **MongoDB**: [para-dao-mongodb](https://github.com/Erudika/para-dao-mongodb)
- **Cassandra**: [para-dao-cassandra](https://github.com/Erudika/para-dao-cassandra)

## Wishlist / Roadmap

- `DAO` implementation for PostgreSQL, etc.
- Server-side JavaScript support for implementing custom API resources
- Integrations with Google App Engine, Heroku, DigitalOcean
- GraphQL and/or ([JSON API](http://jsonapi.org/)) schema support
- Swagger support
